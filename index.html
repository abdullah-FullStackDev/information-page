        <p class="fz">As a newbie, choosing projects that match your current knowledge level can be daunting. You might choose a project. Then the project becomes too big to be accomplished with your currently know-how. At least, that’s what I have gone through on this learning journey.</p>
        <p class="fz">I have curated some projects that I have found that are appropriate even if your knowledge is limited to HTML and CSS only. These projects are available in popular learning websites where you will find additional information on what you will be tackling..</p>
